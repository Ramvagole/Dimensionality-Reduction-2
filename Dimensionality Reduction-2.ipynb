    "is centered around the origin in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance Matrix Calculation:\n",
    "After centering, PCA computes the covariance matrix (Σ) of the centered data. The covariance matrix quantifies the relationships between\n",
    "different pairs of features and reflects how features co-vary with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalue Decomposition:\n",
    "PCA performs an eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix Σ. This decomposition yields a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",
    "The eigenvectors represent the principal components, which are directions in the original feature space. The eigenvalues indicate the \n",
    "amount of variance explained by each principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting Principal Components:\n",
    "PCA ranks the principal components in descending order of the variance they explain. The first principal component (PC1) explains the most\n",
    "variance, the second principal component (PC2) explains the second most, and so on.\n",
    "If some dimensions have high variance while others have low variance, PCA will automatically identify this by assigning high eigenvalues to \n",
    "the PCs corresponding to high-variance dimensions and low eigenvalues to those corresponding to low-variance dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "You can choose to retain a subset of the top-k principal components based on your desired level of dimensionality reduction. This choice\n",
    "allows you to emphasize the directions of high variance and reduce the dimensionality of the data.\n",
    "By selecting fewer principal components, PCA effectively filters out the dimensions with low variance, resulting in a lower-dimensional \n",
    "representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transformation:\n",
    "The selected principal components form a new orthonormal basis for the data. You can project the original data onto this new basis to \n",
    "obtain a lower-dimensional representation.\n",
    "This lower-dimensional representation will emphasize the directions of high variance while de-emphasizing the low-variance dimensions. \n",
    "In essence, PCA accentuates the dimensions that contribute most to the spread and variability in the data.\n",
    "In summary, PCA handles data with high variance in some dimensions and low variance in others by automatically identifying and ranking the\n",
    "principal components based on the variance they explain. It allows you to focus on the dimensions with high variance while effectively \n",
    "reducing the impact of dimensions with low variance, providing a more concise and informative representation of the data. This is especially\n",
    "useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where not all dimensions contribute equally to the overall variability."
